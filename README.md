# MBTA-Map
### Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker
### Description of the project: This tracks the locations of the buses that run between MIT and Harvard. It also shows the bus stop locations.
### How to Run: The map updates every 15 seconds to show real-time bus location. The map can be dragged and zoomed in/out.
### Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to update the location of the bus stops. (These don't look quite right yet!) I would also like to add an image of a bus rather than having the standard location marker.
### License information: This is subject to MIT licensing.
