# MBTA Bus 1 Tracker
This project shows the real-time location of all active buses on route 1.

## Title of the project: 
Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description of the project: 
This tracks the locations of the buses that run between MIT and Harvard. The locations update every 15 seconds.
## How to Run: 
Start by downloading all files in the same folder on your machine. Load the index.html file in your browser. The map updates every 15 seconds to show real-time bus location. The map can be dragged and zoomed in/out.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
In the future I would like to update the location of the bus stops. (These don't look quite right yet!) I would also like to add an image of a bus rather than having the standard location marker.
